    1. We need at least 7 point correspondences to estimate matrix F.
    2. We need at least 8 point correspondences to estimate matrix F.
    3. More point correspondences will not improve accuracy of F as long as 
    the minimum number of points correspondences are provided.
    4. Fundamental matrix contains information about intrinsic camera parameters.
    5. One can recover the rotation and translation (up to scale) from the essential matrix 
    corresponding to the transform between the two views.
    6. The determinant of the fundamental matrix is always 1.
    7. Different normalisation schemes (e.g. transform, transform_v2) may have
    a significant effect on estimation of F. For example, epipoles can deviate.
