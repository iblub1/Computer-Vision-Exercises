def task9_answer():
    """
    Which statements about optical flow estimation are true?
    Provide the corresponding indices in a tuple.

    1. For rectified image pairs, we can estimate optical flow 
       using disparity computation methods.
    2. Lucas-Kanade method allows to solve for large motions in a principled way
       (i.e. without compromise) by simply using a larger patch size.
    3. Coarse-to-fine Lucas-Kanade is robust (i.e. negligible difference in the 
       cost function) to the patch size, in contrast to the single-scale approach.
    4. Lucas-Kanade method implicitly incorporates smoothness constraints, i.e.
       that the flow vector of neighbouring pixels should be similar.
    5. Lucas-Kanade is not robust to brightness changes.
